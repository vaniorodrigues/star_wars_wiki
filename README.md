# A Star Wars Fan Flutter App

## Features:
This app fetchs the list of movies and caracters from a public API https://swapi.dev/documentation. You can add all your favorite movies and caracters to your favorites list, which will be saved using the SQLite library.
The app also features a button that redirects you directly to the https://www.starwars.com/community website, without needing to leave the app. Powered by the flutter package [InAppWebView](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_inappwebview).
It also alows you to create and customize your own avatar! Thanks to the flutter package [Fluttermoji](https://pub.dev/packages/fluttermoji).
